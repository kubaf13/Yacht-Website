## Welcome to my Yacht Renting Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## if you want to start

First, you need to install all node_modules using command:

```bash
npm i
```

and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

In project, You can see project structure. We have here folders like: 
- pages
- public
- src
- styles
- .storybook
- .next


# Next.js
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

In this project I used simple [`NEXT ROUTING`](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction), in catalog `PAGES` you can see all "Page Structure".


## Storybook
As you can see in this project I used technology like [`STORYBOOK`](https://storybook.js.org/) to help me organise my project.

I used also [`ATOMIC DESIGN`](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) to categorise all component which are used in this project.

I seperated them into:
- atoms
- molecules
- organisms
- templates


If you want to see a `STORYBOOK STRUCTURE`, please type this in terminal: 

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Also in `STORYBOOK` I seperated components from templates  


## Theme

To prevent method `DRY` - `don't repeat yourself`, 

I created `Global Styles` in project and `Simple Colour Pallete`. This help me to use these parameters in all components.

Also I created a Layout Component to skip adding navigation and footer to every page.

#ENJOY ;)
